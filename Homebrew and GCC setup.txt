## just copy and paste the commands

step 1: install homebrew
-> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


step 2: after installing homebrew you will see some commands to your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH, just copy and run those commands
## for me, I had this three commands for example:
->  echo >> /Users/sagorahmedmunna/.zprofile
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/sagorahmedmunna/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

step 3: install gcc
-> brew install gcc


step 4: install gtimeout
-> brew install coreutils


step 5:
echo 'alias gcc=gcc-15' >> ~/.zprofile
echo 'alias g++=g++-15' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile


step 6:
echo 'export CC=gcc-15' >> ~/.zprofile
echo 'export CXX=g++-15' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile


## now you are done.
